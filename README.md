# Fundamentals of Deep Learning

This repository is the code companion to [Fundamentals of Deep Learning, Second Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Fundamentals-Deep-Learning-Next-Generation-Intelligence/dp/1491925612 "Fundamentals of Deep Learning") by Nithin Buduma, [Nikhil Buduma](https://github.com/darksigma "Nikhil Buduma"), and [Joe Papa](https://github.com/joe-papa "Joe Papa"), with contributions from [Nicholas Locascio](https://github.com/nicholaslocascio "Nicholas Locascio"). Contributions to the text and code have also been made by [Mostafa Samir](https://github.com/Mostafa-Samir "Mostafa Samir"), [Surya Bhupatiraju](https://github.com/suryabhupa "Surya Bhupatiraju"), and [Anish Athalye](https://github.com/anishathalye "Anish Athalye"). All algorithms in the Second Edition are implemented in [PyTorch](https://www.pytorch.org/ "PyTorch"), one of the most popular machine learning frameworks.

## Guide to the repository

This repo contains code from the Second Edition of Fundamentals of Deep Learning, published in 2022. Code from the First Edition can be found in the first_edition_archive folder. The code from each chapter of the Second Edition can be found in the corresponding folder, if code exists for that chapter. Most of the examples in each chapter are given as Google Colab notebooks. In some cases, .py files have also been included for a more convenient execution of the examples.

## Setting up your development environment
You can run the Google Colab notebooks directly from this github repo. [See instructions on Using Google Colab with GitHub here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb "Using Google Colab with Github").
